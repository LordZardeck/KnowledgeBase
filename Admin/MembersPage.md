When you click on the "Members" tab, a page pushes up that shows everyone who is a member of the community that you are logged in to.

### What does the "Follow" button mean in every Members' profile box? Can you break it down for me?

1. Where is the Follow button?
   
   When you select the Members Tab, you will see every member's name and profile image. Within each profile box you will see    a Follow button in the right hand side. Click the Follow button.

2. What happens when I Follow someone? Why would I want to follow someone?

   When you click Follow, it allows you to view that member's posts. This member will receive an email notification 
   indicating that you are now following them. You want to follow people to ensure you don't miss any of the conversation.

3. Why do I see posts from people I do not follow?

   If the organization "likes" a post from a member you do not follow, it will show up in your Social Feed. This allows you     to discover new content and the members that are of interest to you.

4. Can I unfollow someone?

   Yes. Simply click the box that says Unfollow. When you choose to Follow someone, the button automatically will change to     read Unfollow. The member will not receive an email notification when you Unfollow them.
